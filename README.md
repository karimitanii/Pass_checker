# Pass_checker
This project was highly influenced by the Mr. Robot series and the cybersecurity module in my Digital Cultures course at LAU. Hence, I created this project just for fun, messing around with surface level PHP, HTML and Python (TensorFlow)

This website done locally.

This repo contains:

---- Basic php// html file for the website
---- an image of the Mr Robot series that i used as a background in the website
---- a Python script using TensorFlow that checks the strength of the password entered in the website
